    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a classic New York-style cheesecake with a graham cracker crust and high sides. It is rich, dense, and light at the same time, and serves a small army.

But watch out! Just when you think you've made enough for your gathering, so many people will go back for seconds that you may be left without a piece!</p>

        <li>2/3 cup (160ml) sour cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (160ml) heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>For the sour cream topping</em></h3>
     <ul>   
        <li>2 cups (475ml) sour cream</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (35g) powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>For the raspberry sauce (optional)</em></h3>
     <ul>
        <li>12 ounces (340g) fresh raspberries</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100g) sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3><em>Prepare the crust</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2><em>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</em></h2>
            <p>Arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350°F (175°C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Process the crust ingredients.</h2>
            <p>Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor or blender until finely ground. Put in a large bowl, and stir in the sugar and salt. Stir in the melted butter.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Press into a springform pan:</h2>
            <p>Use a 9x2 3/4-inch round springform pan. Gently press down on the crumbs using your fingers, until the crumbs are a nice even layer at the bottom of the pan, with maybe just a slight rise along the inside edges of the pan.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Bake</h2>
            <p>Place the pan on a baking sheet and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool</p>
            <em><p>Lower the oven temperature to 325°F (160°C).</p></em>
            <p>While the crust is cooling, you can skip ahead and start on the filling. Wait until the crust has cooled to wrap the pan in foil in the next step.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            
            <h2>Triple wrap the pan in heavy duty foil:</h2>
            <p>Prepare the springform pan, so no water leaks into it while cooking. Place a large 18-inch by 18-inch square of heavy duty aluminum foil on a flat surface.</p>
            <p>Place the springform pan in the middle of the foil. Gently fold up the sides of the foil around the pan. Make sure to do this gently, so you don't create any holes in the foil.</p>
            <p>If there are any holes, water will get into the pan and ruin the crust.</p>
            <p>Press the foil around the edges of the pan. Place a second large square of foil underneath the pan, and repeat, gently folding up the sides of the foil around the pan and pressing the foil against the pan.</p>
            <p>To be triply safe, repeat with a third layer of heavy duty foil. Gently crimp the top of the foil sheets around the top edge of the pan.</p>
